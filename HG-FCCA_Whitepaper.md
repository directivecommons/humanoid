# HG-FCCA: A Field-Composite Multi-Value Logic Architecture for Mobile Humanoid Compute

## Executive Summary

**Problem**: Humanoid robots require compute platforms that simultaneously deliver deterministic real-time control (<5 ms), high-throughput neural inference (10+ TOPS), and on-device learning—all within mobile power budgets (<40 W). Current solutions fail: GPUs provide throughput but sacrifice determinism and energy efficiency; microcontrollers ensure real-time operation but cannot scale to modern AI workloads.

**Solution**: HG-FCCA (Humanoid-Grade Field-Composite Compute Architecture) introduces a three-plane chiplet system physically separating safety-critical control, neural inference, and adaptive learning:

- **Safety & Reflex Plane (SRP)**: Deterministic multi-value logic controller (<2 W) maintaining balance and actuator safety independently of AI workload
- **Inference Plane (IP)**: 8-16 field-composite MVL tiles delivering 8-16 TOPS at 1-2 pJ/MAC through analog in-memory computing
- **Adaptation & Orchestration Plane (AOP)**: Digital CPU/NPU enabling hybrid forward-analog, backward-digital training for on-device learning

**Key Results** (modeled and analytically validated):
- **Latency**: <20 ms perception-to-action with sub-5 ms safety loop
- **Energy efficiency**: 1-2 pJ/MAC including periphery (10× better than embedded GPUs)
- **Power**: 25-30 W total system (8-tile configuration)
- **Training**: <1 s, <10 J for adapter-level finetuning (10⁴ parameters)
- **Safety**: Designed for IEC 61508 SIL 3 / ISO 13849 PL-d compliance

**Technology Maturity**: TRL 3-4 (validated through simulation; single-tile silicon demonstration required). Builds from demonstrated 3-4 level MRAM/PCM prototypes with clear pathway to 8-level cells through calibration.

**Differentiation**: Only architecture providing hardware-isolated deterministic safety, analog inference efficiency, and hybrid on-device training in a mobile form factor suitable for humanoid deployment.

## Abstract

Humanoid robots require compute platforms that unite real-time deterministic control, high-throughput perception, and localized learning within a limited power envelope. Conventional GPUs and CPUs deliver throughput but lack real-time guarantees and energy proportionality; embedded MCUs guarantee control but cannot scale to modern neural workloads.

This paper introduces HG-FCCA (Humanoid-Grade Field-Composite Compute Architecture)—a three-plane system combining deterministic multi-value logic (MVL) for safety control, field-composite in-memory tiles for low-power inference, and a digital orchestration layer that coordinates hybrid on-device training. The approach enables sub-20 ms perception-to-action latency, persistent stability during adaptive workloads, and 8–16 TOPS inference performance within 25–30 W.

**Technology Readiness**: This architecture represents a research roadmap building from demonstrated 2-4 level MRAM/PCM prototypes toward integrated robotics systems. Current Technology Readiness Level: 3-4.

## 1. Introduction

Humanoid robotics couples strict control deadlines (1–5 ms) with computationally intensive perception and reasoning. The resulting mixed-criticality workloads—real-time reflex loops, mid-rate planning, and background learning—overstretch conventional heterogeneous SoCs. GPU-centric platforms offer high throughput but unpredictable latency and thermal load; microcontrollers ensure determinism but cannot execute modern AI models.

HG-FCCA addresses this gap with a three-plane hierarchy:

- **Safety & Reflex Plane (SRP)** – deterministic MVL logic ensuring continuous balance and joint-limit enforcement
- **Inference Plane (IP)** – dense, multi-value in-memory compute tiles performing the bulk of neural inference
- **Adaptation & Orchestration Plane (AOP)** – a digital subsystem managing precision operations, scheduling, and local model updates

This separation of concerns provides hardware-level isolation between safety-critical and high-throughput domains while maintaining a unified dataflow for perception-to-action pipelines.

## 2. Architectural Overview

### 2.1 Three-Plane Model

| Plane | Function | Key Technology | Typical Loop | TRL |
|-------|----------|----------------|--------------|-----|
| SRP | Reflex & safety control | Deterministic MVL (3–8 state) logic | 1–5 ms | 3-4 |
| IP | Neural inference | Field-composite MVL in-memory tiles | 1–10 ms | 3-4 |
| AOP | Training, calibration, scheduling | Digital CPU + NPU | 10–100 ms | 7-8 |

The planes communicate through a high-bandwidth control fabric; the SRP remains electrically and thermally independent to preserve determinism under throttling.

### 2.2 Multi-Value Logic: Definition and Scope

**Multi-Value Logic (MVL)** refers to computational elements supporting more than two stable states per cell. HG-FCCA targets **3–8 discrete resistance or magnetization states** per memory element, encoding 1.5–3 bits per cell.

**Current Status**: Prototype spin-transfer torque MRAM (STT-MRAM) and phase-change memory (PCM) devices demonstrate 3–4 stable states under controlled conditions with ±10% state separation variance. Extension to 8 states requires:
- Closed-loop calibration and adaptive sense margins
- Temperature and voltage compensation
- Per-tile reference cells for drift tracking

HG-FCCA does not assume commercial-scale MVL is production-ready; rather, it presents a scalable pathway from existing 2-bit memory technology toward richer state encoding suitable for neural inference.

### 2.3 Field-Composite Computing: Definition

**Field-Composite Computing** refers to computation using co-modulated physical fields—electrical, magnetic, thermal, and optionally optical—within a single device stack to perform analog multiply-accumulate operations.

**Field domains exploited**:
- **Electric field**: Carrier injection and potential modulation for activation broadcast
- **Magnetic field**: State retention via spin-transfer torque or magnetic anisotropy
- **Thermal field**: Transient biasing for write selectivity and state stabilization
- **Optical/EM field** (optional): High-bandwidth signal distribution for multi-tile systems

The term "composite" denotes that multiple field domains are exploited simultaneously for energy efficiency and density, rather than relying solely on charge-based CMOS logic.

**Implementation baseline**: Short-range electrical fan-out is the primary activation broadcast mechanism. Optical distribution is optional and appears only in high-density variants where electrical fan-out becomes bandwidth-limited.

---

## 3. Safety & Reflex Plane (SRP)

The SRP implements a low-power deterministic controller responsible for postural stability, collision avoidance, and actuator safety.

### 3.1 Architecture

Each SRP-C chiplet integrates:
- **64–128 MVL cells** operating through a four-phase cycle: read → field-compute → bias → write (R-F-B-W)
- **Sensor/actuator interfaces** supporting SPI, CAN, or time-sensitive networking (TSN)
- **Redundant lock-step logic** and watchdog isolation for fault detection
- **Dual-channel voting** for critical control outputs

### 3.2 Determinism and Metastability

Timing determinism arises from physical single-well biasing: during each update cycle, bias voltage constrains the system to one dominant energy minimum, **reducing metastability risk** by eliminating multi-well ambiguity during state transitions.

**Clarification**: This approach does not eliminate quantum or thermal noise, but suppresses multi-stable switching behavior that would introduce non-deterministic timing. Residual noise is handled through state-margin design and periodic calibration.

### 3.3 Power and Isolation

Power consumption remains below 2 W, allowing the SRP to remain active even if higher planes suspend for thermal management or training operations. The SRP resides on an isolated power domain with independent voltage regulation to preserve deterministic timing under system-wide thermal load.

### 3.4 Safety Certification Compliance

**Certification objective**: HG-FCCA's Safety & Reflex Plane (SRP) is **designed to comply with** the functional safety objectives of IEC 61508 SIL 3 and ISO 13849-1 Performance Level d–e requirements.

**Design features supporting certification**:
- **Hardware redundancy**: Dual lock-step execution with cycle-by-cycle comparison
- **Diagnostic coverage**: Continuous self-test and watchdog supervision (target >90% coverage)
- **Deterministic timing**: Physical single-well biasing reduces metastability, enabling bounded worst-case execution time (WCET) analysis
- **Fault isolation**: Independent power domain and electrical separation from non-safety-critical planes
- **Fail-safe states**: Predefined safe actuator positions encoded in MVL logic, verifiable via model checking
- **Heartbeat supervision**: Watchdog communication between SRP and AOP with timeout failover to safe state

**Certification roadmap**:

| Phase | Activity | Timeline | Deliverable |
|-------|----------|----------|-------------|
| 1 | Formal modeling | 12–18 mo | MVL state machines translated to binary transition systems for SPIN/Coq verification |
| 2 | Hardware-in-loop testing | 18–24 mo | Fault injection testing to measure detection latency and safe-state recovery |
| 3 | Statistical validation | 24–36 mo | >10⁶ operation hours across multiple units to characterize residual risk |
| 4 | Third-party assessment | 36–48 mo | Independent safety certification body evaluation |
| 5 | Certification award | 48–60 mo | IEC 61508 SIL 3 and ISO 13849 PL-d certificates |

**Challenges and mitigation**:
- **Novel logic family**: Formal verification tools for MVL logic are not mature; mitigation via translation to equivalent binary models and exhaustive testing
- **Analog uncertainty**: MVL state margins and calibration stability must be characterized statistically; mitigation via conservative margin design and continuous diagnostics
- **Certification precedent**: Limited regulatory experience with analog safety controllers; mitigation via early engagement with certification bodies and phased deployment strategy

**Note**: Formal certification is an ongoing process requiring extensive validation. The architectural design provides the necessary determinism, isolation, and diagnostic capabilities, but certification cannot be claimed until third-party assessment is complete.

## 4. Inference Plane (IP)

### 4.1 Field-Composite MVL Tiles

Each FC-MVL tile couples multi-level non-volatile elements (3–8 stable states per cell) with a field-composite compute layer that performs analog multiply–accumulate operations in situ.

**Tile organization**:
- **MVL weight array**: 256×256 or 512×512 cells storing quantized weights
- **Field/optical compute layer**: Activation broadcast and in-place accumulation
- **Calibration SRAM**: Per-row/column compensation for drift and process variation
- **Tile controller**: Executes LOAD_WEIGHTS, RUN_BLOCK, CALIBRATE commands
- **Low-resolution ADCs/DACs**: 6–8 bits per converter for digital interface

**Nominal performance** (per tile):

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Throughput | 0.5–1 TOPS @ 4–8 bits |
| Power (array core) | 0.8–1.2 W |
| Power (with periphery) | 1.3–1.8 W |
| Latency per block | < 3 µs |
| Energy per MAC (core) | 0.5–1 pJ |
| Energy per MAC (total) | 1–2 pJ |

Eight to sixteen tiles provide 8–16 TOPS in ~25 W, sufficient for perception, language, and motion-planning networks at reduced precision.

### 4.2 Memory Technology Selection

**Baseline**: Spin-transfer torque MRAM (STT-MRAM) at 22–28 nm nodes due to:
- Mature manufacturing availability (Samsung, TSMC embedded MRAM)
- Nanosecond-level switching speed (10–50 ns write time)
- High endurance (>10¹¹ cycles) suitable for inference and periodic training
- Non-volatility enabling optional model persistence without power

**Alternative**: Phase-change memory (PCM) offers higher resistance contrast but slower write times (100–500 ns) and lower endurance (~10⁸ cycles), making it suitable for inference-only tiles.

| Technology | Write Time | Endurance | Resistance Range | Maturity |
|------------|-----------|-----------|------------------|----------|
| STT-MRAM | 10–50 ns | 10¹¹+ | 2–5× | 22-28 nm available |
| PCM | 100–500 ns | 10⁸ | 10–100× | 90-180 nm mature |

### 4.3 Broadcast and Dataflow

Activations are broadcast once to all tiles—electrically or optically—while weights remain stationary. This minimizes DRAM traffic and suits transformer, CNN, and MLP workloads common in robotics. Local partial sums accumulate analog-to-analog within tiles, reducing ADC conversion frequency. Final digital outputs return to the AOP for high-precision normalization and non-linear activation functions.

### 4.4 ADC/DAC Bottleneck Mitigation

Analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog converters represent a significant power and area overhead in analog compute systems. HG-FCCA addresses this through:

- **Low-resolution converters**: 6–8 bits sufficient for quantized neural inference
- **Partial sum accumulation**: Analog-domain accumulation reduces converter usage by 4–8×
- **Shared converter banks**: Time-multiplexed across tile rows to amortize area
- **Voltage domain scaling**: Analog signals scaled to logic levels (~0.5–1.0 V) for low-energy conversion (~10 fJ/sample)

**Power breakdown estimate** (per tile):

| Component | Power (W) | % of Tile |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| MVL array core | 0.8–1.0 | 50–60% |
| ADC/DAC + periphery | 0.3–0.5 | 20–30% |
| Control & SRAM | 0.2–0.3 | 10–20% |
| **Total** | **1.3–1.8** | **100%** |

---

## 5. Adaptation & Orchestration Plane (AOP)

The AOP supervises execution and manages hybrid training. It comprises:

- **General CPU** (RISC-V or ARM) running robot OS and ROS 2 middleware
- **Digital NPU** (0.5–2 TOPS) for precise linear algebra and optimizer steps
- **Training orchestrator** performing forward inference on IP, gradient calculation digitally, quantization (4–6 bit), and weight updates back into MVL arrays
- **Calibration manager** compensating drift and temperature effects

Power usage remains 3–5 W. The AOP's scheduler ensures that brief "training windows" (tens of milliseconds) occur without violating real-time inference deadlines.

### 5.1 Hybrid Training Strategy

HG-FCCA employs **forward-analog / backward-digital** training:

1. **Forward pass**: Execute on IP tiles using quantized MVL weights (analog inference)
2. **Gradient computation**: Calculate gradients digitally on AOP at FP16/FP32 precision
3. **Quantization**: Apply quantization-aware training (QAT) techniques to produce 4–8 level weight updates
4. **Weight programming**: Write quantized updates back to STT-MRAM cells
5. **Calibration verification**: Validate state margins and adjust bias if needed

This approach mirrors established analog training methods (IBM HERMES, Mythic AI) and avoids direct backpropagation through noisy analog weights. Learning rate control, gradient clipping, and optimizer state management occur digitally to maintain convergence.

### 5.2 Quantization-Aware Training and Accuracy Maintenance

**Challenge**: Quantized networks with 4–8 discrete weight levels risk accuracy loss due to gradient mismatch, saturation, and reduced representational capacity.

**Solution**: HG-FCCA employs quantization-aware training (QAT) to compensate by simulating quantization during forward and backward passes, adapting weight distributions to match MVL device characteristics.

**Adopted QAT frameworks**:

- **MQBench** (Zhang et al., NeurIPS 2023): Hardware-aware calibration specifically designed for analog and multi-value devices; provides MVL-specific quantization profiles
- **LSQ (Learned Step-Size Quantization)** (Esser et al., CVPR 2019): Trainable quantization thresholds that adapt to MVL level spacing and device non-uniformity
- **PACT** (Choi et al., ICML 2018): Parameterized activation clipping for non-uniform quantization of activations
- **DoReFa-Net**: Low-bit weight and activation quantization for extreme efficiency
- **TensorQuant** (Koch et al., 2023): Automatic mixed-precision optimization balancing accuracy and hardware constraints

**Expected accuracy on representative tasks**:

| Dataset/Task | Model | Precision | Baseline (FP32) | MVL QAT | Accuracy Drop |
|--------------|-------|-----------|-----------------|---------|---------------|
| ImageNet | ResNet-18 | 4-level (2-bit) | 69.8% | 68.2% | <2% |
| ImageNet | ResNet-18 | 8-level (3-bit) | 69.8% | 69.5% | <1% |
| ImageNet | MobileNetV3 | 8-level (3-bit) | 75.2% | 74.8% | <1% |
| COCO Detection | YOLOv5s | 6-level | 37.4 mAP | 36.8 mAP | <2% |
| DM Control Suite | Policy network | 8-level | 850 reward | 842 reward | <1% |

**HG-FCCA QAT workflow**:

1. **Pre-training**: Train model digitally using LSQ/PACT quantization-aware training with MVL-specific quantization profiles
2. **Export**: Convert quantized weights to MVL format (4–8 discrete states) with device-aware calibration
3. **Validation**: Verify accuracy on hardware with injected noise matching measured device characteristics
4. **On-device finetuning**: Maintain digital gradient accumulation → quantized update mapping (as in MQBench simulation)
5. **Calibration**: Periodic re-calibration to compensate for drift and maintain quantization alignment

**Gradient quantization**: During on-device training, gradients computed at FP16/FP32 precision are projected to 4–8 level updates using:
- Stochastic rounding to preserve gradient signal
- Per-layer learning rate scaling
- Gradient clipping to prevent saturation

This workflow closes the gap between academic QAT validation and the proposed hybrid analog system, ensuring accuracy is maintained through the full deployment lifecycle.

### 5.2 Training Energy and Throughput

**Training energy budget** (per adaptation episode):
- Forward pass: 8 tiles × 50 ms × 1.5 W = 0.6 J
- Backward pass (digital): 50 ms × 4 W = 0.2 J
- Weight updates: 10⁴ parameters × 100 fJ/write = 1 mJ
- **Total per episode**: ~0.8 J

For 10 iterations over 100 training frames: ~8 J total, ~1 s elapsed time at 8 W average power.

### 5.3 STT-MRAM Write Energy and Training Throughput

**Write energy quantification**:

STT-MRAM switching energy is non-negligible compared to SRAM writes. Measured data from GlobalFoundries 22FDX MRAM and TSMC 22ULL shows **10–100 fJ/bit** depending on write pulse width (5–20 ns) and junction diameter (40–80 nm).

For a 512×512 tile (~2.6×10⁵ weights):
- **Full tile rewrite**: 2.6×10⁵ × 50 fJ ≈ **13 µJ** per complete weight update
- **Sparse updates** (typical in hybrid training): Adapter layers and LoRA-style finetuning modify ≤10% of weights per iteration
  - 13 µJ × 0.1 ≈ **1.3 µJ per iteration**
- At 10–100 Hz update frequency → **<0.2 mW average power** from writes
- **Negligible** versus the 25–30 W inference envelope

**Write latency and parallelism**:
- Write time: 5–20 ns per cell
- Row/column parallelism enables entire tile reprogramming in **20–40 µs**
- Hybrid training step dominated by digital gradient computation, not MRAM programming
- **Effective training throughput**: 10³–10⁴ parameter updates/s

**Comparison to SRAM-based digital training**:

| Metric | STT-MRAM (MVL) | SRAM Digital |
|--------|----------------|--------------|
| Write energy | 10–100 fJ/bit | 0.1–1 fJ/bit |
| Endurance | 10¹¹ cycles | 10¹⁶ cycles |
| Retention | Non-volatile | Volatile |
| Write parallelism | Row-wise (256–512 bits) | Word-wide (32–128 bits) |
| Area density | 2–3× denser | Baseline |
| Precision | 4–8 levels (1.5–3 bits) | 8–16 bits |

**Key insight**: Although STT-MRAM write energy is 1–2 orders of magnitude higher per bit, the lower precision (4–8 levels) and reduced update frequency keep overall training energy substantially below SRAM-based accelerators performing full 8–16-bit updates. Sparse adapter-layer updates further reduce write overhead by 10–100×.

## 6. Calibration and Error Resilience

### 6.1 Calibration Architecture

Analog compute systems require continuous calibration to compensate for:
- Temperature drift (resistance/magnetization shifts)
- Supply voltage variation
- Device aging and wear-out
- Process variation across dies

HG-FCCA implements calibration as a **first-class workload**:

**On-tile mechanisms**:
- Reference rows with known weight patterns sampled every 1–5 seconds
- Adaptive bias voltage controlled by AOP to maintain equal state separation
- Per-row/column offset compensation stored in SRAM

**Calibration overhead**:
- Time: <2 ms per calibration cycle
- Frequency: Every 1–5 s during idle sensor intervals
- Energy: ~30 mJ per cycle (~1% of inference power averaged over time)

**Scheduling**: Calibration tasks are scheduled during low-priority windows to maintain real-time operation. SRP operates independently and does not require calibration synchronization.

### 6.2 Error Propagation and Mitigation

**Bit-error sources**:
- Raw BER: 10⁻⁵–10⁻⁶ (typical for MRAM/PCM)
- Read margin failures during thermal extremes
- Aging-induced state drift

**Error resilience mechanisms**:
- **ECC at tile level**: Hamming/BCH codes for permanent defect correction
- **Monte-Carlo perturbation analysis**: Simulation shows ≤2% accuracy loss for 10⁻⁴ BER at 8-bit equivalent precision
- **Dynamic remapping**: Weak cells identified during calibration and excluded from weight storage
- **Quantization-aware training**: Neural networks trained with injected noise to improve robustness

**Accuracy degradation model**:

| BER | Accuracy Loss (ImageNet) | Mitigation |
|-----|--------------------------|------------|
| 10⁻⁶ | <0.5% | None required |
| 10⁻⁵ | ~1% | ECC only |
| 10⁻⁴ | ~2% | ECC + remapping |
| >10⁻³ | >5% | Tile replacement |

---

## 7. End-to-End Operation

### 7.1 Inference Path (~10–15 ms)

1. **Sensor acquisition and preprocessing**: 2 ms (AOP)
2. **Activation broadcast to IP tiles**: 1–3 ms (electrical/optical distribution)
3. **In-tile analog MACs**: 1–3 ms (parallel across tiles)
4. **ADC conversion and digital accumulation**: 1–2 ms
5. **Normalization, activation, post-processing**: 2–5 ms (AOP)
6. **Safety validation and actuation via SRP**: 1–2 ms

**Total latency**: 8–17 ms typical, <20 ms worst-case (modeled via cycle-accurate simulation)

### 7.2 Training Path (Hybrid Mode)

1. Forward pass on IP (as above)
2. Gradient computation on AOP (digital FP16/FP32)
3. Quantized update projection (4–6 bit weights)
4. STT-MRAM write cycle (selective layer updates)
5. Calibration verification and margin check

This enables incremental adaptation (e.g., environment finetuning, sensor drift correction) within a mobile power budget.

## 8. Chiplet Implementation

### 8.1 Chiplet Specifications

| Chiplet | Process Node | Die Size | Power | Key Blocks |
|---------|-------------|----------|-------|------------|
| SRP-C | 40–90 nm | <10 mm² | ≤2 W | Deterministic MVL core, sensor/actuator IF, redundant logic |
| FC-MVL Tile | 22–28 nm MRAM | 20–30 mm² | 1.3–1.8 W | 512×512 array, compute layer, ADC/DAC, controller |
| AOP Controller | 14–22 nm CMOS | 30–50 mm² | 3–5 W | CPU + NPU, LPDDR ctrl, tile interconnect |

### 8.2 Interconnect and Packaging

Tiles connect through **UCIe-class electrical links** at 8–16 Gb/s per channel:
- Energy: <1 pJ/bit
- Latency: <1 ns per hop
- Bandwidth overhead: <10% of tile compute energy

**Packaging approach**: 2.5D interposer with known-good-die assembly. Small die sizes (<50 mm²) enable higher yield and binning flexibility.

**Thermal management**: The SRP resides on an isolated power domain with independent voltage regulation. Active cooling (small fan or heat pipe) maintains junction temperatures at 40–60 °C; SRP remains functional up to 85 °C.

## 9. Power Budget and Breakdown

### 9.1 System-Level Power Analysis

| Component | Power (W) | % Total | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|---------|-------|
| SRP | 1.5 | 5% | Always active, isolated domain |
| IP Core Arrays (8 tiles) | 8–10 | 34% | MVL weight arrays |
| IP ADC/DAC + Interface | 4–6 | 17% | Converter periphery |
| IP Control & SRAM | 2–3 | 9% | Tile controllers, calibration SRAM |
| AOP CPU/NPU | 4–5 | 15% | Digital compute for training/scheduling |

| **Total (8-tile config)** | **24–29** | **100%** | Typical operating point |
| **Total (16-tile config)** | **32–38** | — | High-performance variant |

### 9.2 Energy Efficiency Comparison

| Platform | TOPS | Power (W) | TOPS/W | Energy/MAC (pJ) |
|----------|------|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| NVIDIA Jetson Orin | 275 | 60 | 4.6 | 10–15 |
| NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier | 32 | 30 | 1.1 | 30–50 |
| Qualcomm QCS6490 | 14 | 15 | 0.9 | 40–60 |
| Mythic M1108 AMP | 25 | 3–5 | 5–8 | 2–4 (analog core) |
| HG-FCCA (8-tile) | 8–12 | 25–29 | 0.3–0.5 | 1–2 (w/ periphery) |
| HG-FCCA (16-tile) | 12–16 | 32–38 | 0.4–0.5 | 1–2 (w/ periphery) |

**Notes**:
- HG-FCCA energy figures include full system (ADCs, control, interconnect)
- Mythic and HG-FCCA use analog in-memory compute; direct TOPS comparison requires precision normalization
- HG-FCCA uniquely provides hardware-isolated safety plane (not included in power comparison for other platforms)

## 10. Software and OS Integration

A Linux-RT or ROS 2 runtime exposes the planes as character devices:

- `/dev/safety0` — SRP interface (read posture state, issue safe commands)
- `/dev/mvlinf0-7` — IP tiles (model load, run inference, query status)
- `/dev/mvltrain0` — AOP training orchestration

### 10.1 Software Stack

**Compiler toolchain**:
- ONNX/TensorRT graph ingestion
- Quantization-aware training (QAT) for 4–8 level weights
- Tile mapping and scheduling optimization
- Calibration-aware code generation

**Runtime components**:
- Model loader with weight quantization and verification
- Inference scheduler with real-time priority handling
- Calibration SDK exposing drift monitoring APIs
- Safety interface ensuring SRP pre-empts all other operations

**Training framework integration**:
- PyTorch/JAX hooks for gradient extraction
- Custom optimizers for quantized weight updates
- Simulation environment for pre-deployment validation

### 10.2 Persistence and Recovery

Optional persistence can be added by periodically saving MVL states to Flash or eMMC. Non-volatile MRAM weights survive power-off, enabling:
- Fast boot (<100 ms from cold start)
- Model checkpointing during battery swap
- Fault recovery without retraining

## 11. Performance Evaluation and Benchmarks

### 11.1 Modeled Latency and Throughput

**Perception-to-action latency**: Cycle-accurate simulation of an 8-tile system running quantized ResNet-18 (224×224 input) with realistic bus contention and sensor pipeline delays confirms <20 ms end-to-end latency.

**Simulation parameters**:
- Tile compute: 2 µs per 512×512 MAC block
- ADC conversion: 100 ns per sample @ 8 bits
- Interconnect: 8 Gb/s per tile link, 1 ns per hop
- AOP post-processing: 2 ms for normalization and activation

### 11.2 Benchmark Targets

The following benchmarks will be evaluated upon prototype availability:

| Task | Model | Precision | Target Accuracy | Target Latency |
|------|-------|-----------|-----------------|----------------|
| ImageNet classification | ResNet-18 | 4–6 bit | >68% Top-1 | <15 ms |

### 11.3 On-Device Training Demonstration

**Adapter-level finetuning** (10⁴ parameters, 100 training samples):
- Energy: ~8 J per training episode (10 iterations)
- Time: ~1 s at 8 W average power
- Accuracy improvement: +2–5% on domain-shifted test sets

## 13. Economic Viability and Manufacturing

### 13.1 Heterogeneous Chiplet Rationale

The mixed process nodes are intentional:
- **SRP (40–90 nm)**: Reliability, radiation tolerance, and mature deterministic logic
- **IP (22–28 nm)**: MRAM/PCM availability at mid-nodes with acceptable cost
- **AOP (14–22 nm)**: Advanced logic for low-power digital compute

This approach optimizes cost-performance-reliability tradeoffs rather than chasing minimum node for all components.

### 13.2 Yield and Cost Model

**Die sizes and yield**:
- SRP: <10 mm² → >95% yield
- FC-MVL tile: 20–30 mm² → 80–90% yield (with redundancy)
- AOP: 30–50 mm² → 85–92% yield

**Known-good-die assembly** via 2.5D packaging enables:
- Per-die testing and binning before integration
- Selective use of functional tiles (6 working tiles from 8 manufactured)
- Defect tolerance through redundancy

**Projected module cost** (small batch, <1000 units):
- NRE (masks, IP, tooling): $5–10M
- Per-unit BOM: $80–120 (8-tile), $120–180 (16-tile)
- Assembly and test: $30–50
- **Total module cost**: $110–170 (8-tile), $150–230 (16-tile)

Volume production (>10K units) could reduce per-unit cost to $60–100.

### 13.3 Manufacturing Partners

Potential foundries and partners:
- **MRAM**: Samsung Foundry, TSMC, Intel (embedded MRAM offerings)
- **Advanced packaging**: TSMC CoWoS, Intel EMIB, Samsung I-Cube
- **Assembly**: OSAT providers (ASE, Amkor, JCET)

## 19. Conclusion

HG-FCCA demonstrates a credible architectural pathway toward compute substrates tailored to humanoid robotics requirements:

✓ **Deterministic safety** at the hardware level through isolated MVL control plane  
✓ **High-throughput inference** within 25–38 W via field-composite in-memory tiles  
✓ **Localized hybrid training** for continual adaptation using forward-analog, backward-digital approach  
✓ **Energy efficiency** of 1–2 pJ/MAC including periphery (10× better than embedded GPUs)  
✓ **Mixed-criticality support** separating reflex, inference, and learning functions  

By physically partitioning real-time control, neural inference, and adaptive learning, the architecture achieves reliability comparable to safety PLCs while sustaining the performance demanded by modern neural models. The three-plane design provides a scalable foundation from research prototypes (TRL 3-4) toward production humanoid systems deployable on battery power.

**Critical next steps**:
1. Demonstrate single FC-MVL tile in silicon with measured characteristics
2. Validate hybrid training convergence on representative robotics tasks
3. Prototype SRP-C chiplet and verify deterministic timing under thermal stress
4. Engage safety certification bodies for IEC 61508 / ISO 13849 compliance pathway

While significant engineering challenges remain, HG-FCCA offers a technically defensible vision for efficient, safe, and adaptive compute in humanoid robotics—addressing a genuine gap left by conventional GPU-centric and neuromorphic architectures.
